<p>signifies that a plugin favors regular block-sizes over sample-accurate
control data.</p>
<p>The host should preferably call the plugin with the same block-size
continuously.</p>
<p>Note that this does not guarantee a fixed block-size. The process cycle may
be split for other reasons (e.g. looping), and the blocksize itself may change
anytime.</p>

treated as bypassed.)</p>
